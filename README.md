# Carnival-Conquest
This project was created during the FIEA Game Jam, a 48-hour event with teams of four participants. The prompt for the jam was "amusement park."
Our team developed a split-screen competitive game where players aim to achieve the highest scores in various carnival mini-games within the time limit.
